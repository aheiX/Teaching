        "The TSP is one of the most famous combinatorial problems in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and operations research. The classical definition of the TSP is as follows: What is the shortest possible route for a traveling salesperson seeking to visit each city on a list exactly once and return to his city of origin? (Cook, William (2012): *In Pursuit of the Travelin Salesman*).\n",
        "\n",
        "While the problem is easy to understand and easy to formulate as a mathematical model, solving it to optimality through complete enumeration of all feasible solutions quickly becomes intractable as the number of potential solutions grows exponentially in the number of cities to visit.\n",

        "To date, there exists no algorithm that solves the TSP to optimality in polynomial time and it is widely believed that there is no such algorithm. However, heuristics are usually capable of finding very good solutions in a short computation time. "
